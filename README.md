# Front End implementation of Capstone API created for CoStar

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Start by downloading yarn if you do not have it. You can download yarn from [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

### Installing

First move into the 'front-end' directory, then install the dependencies.
```
cd front-end
yarn install
```

Finally you can run the application on the development server (http://localhost:3000) with the folowing command:

```
yarn start
```

### Server

This is a front-end application for the Natural Search Flask app located [here](https://github.com/joshsticks/Capstone). For the front-end to work correctly the sever must be started per the instructions in the README. This application assumes that the sever is running on localhost:5000. To change this, you just simply change the 'proxy' in the package.json.
